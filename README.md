# Motivation and Goal

Collectors plan their arrival at the airport mainly on the basis of the aircraft's landing time. However, it would be more important to know when the passenger leaves the aircraft and when his or her luggage is lying on the baggage carousel. This pick-up time would then be the same as the baggage claim period. Provided that the passenger does not only travel with hand luggage. This is a problem, because there are several variables that affect this period of baggage claim. For example, apart from the landing time, the position and size of the aircraft. To give the collector a better window to pick up, we would like to predict the time of baggage claim. A period in which the passenger is likely to leave the airport.
